# Contour-Map

This project was inspired by elevation contour maps. Aren't they cool? I think so.

The project is written in Python for Processing 3. Hills are modeled using bivariate gaussian curves, and rendered with a custom OpenGL fragment shader since this is a highly-paralellizable animation.
